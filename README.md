# Electronic Learning System

As new Service members join the ranks in the military they are asked to progress in their professional education. 
There are many programs available that cater to the individualâ€™s growth with academics, but none provide an individual career learning path. 

One of the areas that is encouraged to improve is with correspondence courses, in other words distance learning, with a variety of subjects. 
Most service members are not aware that the capabilities of the learning programs that are provide, which makes it harder for them to pinpoint subjects that will directly benefit their growth. 
With the learning path easily accessible to the individual they can see what certifications they require and how to approach the courses they enroll in.

Electronic Learning System (ELS) will give Service members the ability to locate courses that are unique with their profession. 
While still having valuable resources that may interest them.

The required information to register is below. 
+	First and Last name
+	Career Field/Occupation
+	Employee ID/Department of Defense ID
+	Work/Personal e-mail
+	Current Rank/Title
+	Username/password

Once the account has been activated, they will be able to view courses that either directly relate to their Career Field/Occupation or the civilian version, if available. 
Users capabilities will be to access and sort through courses that have video capability. 
Their accomplishments will be available with printable certifications. Users are limited to registration, course selection/dropping, and maintaining their profile.

Only Site Managers will be allowed administrator role. 
This will allow proper maintenance on the website and to provide support to Users.
The data capture by this system will only store the basic user information and courses completed.

My program containts a `Main()` method.
My program looks like this:

~~~cs
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
}
~~~
